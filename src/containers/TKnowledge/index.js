      <ListStyled lineHeight='38px' data={['Work Type: College Project', 'Year: 2020', 'Tools: Figma', 'Role: UI/UX Designer', 'Teams: 4 Members (Astari D. Rahmanisa, Ananda Daffa, Deana A. Putri, Yuvitri Annisa D.)']}/>

      <TitleStyled>Background</TitleStyled>
      <ParagraphStyled>Currently, many companies still have some limitations in terms of knowledge management practices. Majorities of case studies I have read stated that the limitation is mostly due to knowledge that remains tacit and has not been documented yet. Thus, my team tried to analyze knowledge management practices in a certain company. Then, based on the analysis, we proposed a recommendation to enhance their knowledge management practices in the form of a Knowledge Management System design.</ParagraphStyled>
      <ParagraphStyled>In this project, we chose a case study of knowledge management practices in T Industries. As a result, we designed a Knowledge Management System to help every employee of T Industries to share their knowledge and learn from others.</ParagraphStyled>

      <TitleStyled>Problem Identification</TitleStyled>
      <ParagraphStyled>As I cannot publicly share the list of problems in detail, I would like to share how my team could identify the problems. My team had to <b>analyze problems</b> that were faced by T Industries on their business processes <b>which the root cause was the lack of knowledge management practice</b> or the lack of knowledge transfer.</ParagraphStyled>

      <TitleStyled>Solution</TitleStyled>
      <ParagraphStyled>In order to come up with a solution, my team had to assess contingency factors in T Industries to prioritize needed knowledge management processes. Here I attach the result which describes prioritized processes and features for each process.</ParagraphStyled>

      <TitleStyled>Interface Design <span role='img' aria-label='design'>ðŸ”®</span></TitleStyled>
      <ParagraphStyled>T Industries Knowledge designed as a web-based system so that T Industries employees can access the system easily. Members responsible for creating T Industries Knowledge interface design and flow were me and my teammate, Deana, then we split the task based on features. I was responsible for creating the design system, interface design for Home Page, Discussion Forum, and Best Practice Database. However, we also collaborated in designing Login Page and About Company.</ParagraphStyled>

      <SubTitle>Login</SubTitle>
      <ParagraphStyled>Me and Deana were responsible for creating the Login Page. We did a little bit of exploration in designing the interface.</ParagraphStyled>
