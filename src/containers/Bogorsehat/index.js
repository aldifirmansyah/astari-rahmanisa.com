      <ListStyled lineHeight='38px' data={['Work Type: College Project', 'Year: 2019', 'Tools: Figma', 'Role: UI/UX Designer', 'Teams: 5 Members (Astari D. Rahmanisa, Aldi Firmansyah, Athifa Michel, Deana A. Putri, Hauri S. Zafirah)']}/>

      <TitleStyled>Background</TitleStyled>
      <ParagraphStyled>Indonesian Ministry of Health claims that the level of awareness in Indonesian people regarding health and hygiene is still considered low, especially in the rural areas (Ucu, 2019). Based on data from the AIA Healthy Living Index (2018), only around 49% of Indonesians undergo health checks. This means that half of Indonesians are not aware of the importance of health checks.</ParagraphStyled>

      <TitleStyled>Problem Identification</TitleStyled>
      <ParagraphStyled>Our team identified that most people in our surroundings (friends, family, etc) felt that undergo a health check is frustrating due to its long waiting list. As for now, we also live in the technology era, so people expect that they can book doctors throughout their mobile phones to prevent the waiting list. Unfortunately, only a few health facilities in Indonesia that provide online booking.</ParagraphStyled>

      <TitleStyled>Solution</TitleStyled>
      <ParagraphStyled>Referring to the background and problem previously described, BogorSehat was designed with the aim of facilitating Indonesian people's access to simple health checks. We also wanted to take part in helping the Ministry of Health increase the awareness of Indonesian's the importance of health checks as a preventive measure, helping to increase awareness of the Indonesian regarding health. Therefore, we chose a niche location first, which is Bogor, so that the impact can be easily assessed. We chose Bogor since it already make use of technology such as mobile application for their public services.</ParagraphStyled>
