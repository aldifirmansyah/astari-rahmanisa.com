      <TitleStyled>Background</TitleStyled>
      <ParagraphStyled>Tjetak Knowledge is a Knowledge Management System designed for the entire company of Tjetak. Currently, Tjetak has several knowledges that remain tacit and have not been documented yet. In terms of sharing documents for each business unit, Tjetak had already used a team collaboration tools. However, Tjetak does not have a dedicated place for its employee to share their knowledge and experience. Thus, there is a need to develop a Knowledge Management System to help every employee of Tjetak to share their knowledge and learn from others.</ParagraphStyled>

      <TitleStyled>Problem Identification</TitleStyled>
      <ParagraphStyled>As I cannot publicly share the list of problems in detail, I would like to share how my team could identify the problems. My team had to <b>analyze problems</b> that were faced by Tjetak on their business processes <b>which the root cause was the lack of knowledge management practice</b> or the lack of knowledge transfer.</ParagraphStyled>

      <TitleStyled>Solution</TitleStyled>
      <ParagraphStyled>In order to come up with a solution, my team had to assess contingency factors in Tjetak to prioritize needed knowledge management processes. Here I attach the result which describes prioritized processes and features for each process.</ParagraphStyled>
